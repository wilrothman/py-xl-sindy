    "I implemented the following files:\n",
    "- `example/minimal_example_wil` (minimal example (Mujoco) on the double pendulum xml file)\n",
    "- `data_collection/real_pend_data.py` (collects data from the real pendulum. Just connect it to Hebi Scope (via the ethernet chord) and it just works)\n",

    "# 2. `minimal_example_real.py`\n",
    "## 2.1 Description\n",
    "I implemented this on top of `example/minimal_example_modular.py`. The basic idea of it is, instead of extracting data from Mujoco, I extract data from the CSV generated by `data_collection/real_pend_data.py`. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of **combined** (i.e., stiched together from multiple trials) output from this `data_collection/real_pend_data.py` can be found on `README_report_25_12_22/outputs/compiled.csv`. \n",
    "\n",
    "I then made the time series data *monotonic*, meaning that I stitched together trials and mannually increased the \"time\" variable (for instance, from the first to second trial, instead of t = 4.999 to 0.000, I changed that to 4.999 to 5.000). See `.../outputs/compiled.csv`. Note SINDy crashes when I don't do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Issue\n",
    "The issue is that the program does not give me reasonable outputs. Usually, the program just fails.Sometimes it gives a partial result like the followign:\n",

    "<img src=\"./outputs/trajectory_comparison_e25fcbc4.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"auto\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "I have no idea why this happens, but I have made the following **observations**. \n",
    "\n",
    "First the \"`_vs`\" validation coordinates only have 13 entries and terminate after a second. Furthermore, notice how large the `qvel` and `qacc` values become (note, 0 is the shoulder angular trajectory and 1 is the elbow angular trajectory).\n",
    "\n",
    "(See `README_.../outputs/irl_vs_test.csv`)\n",
    "(You can also see the test (\"`_v`\") trajectory at `README_.../outputs/irl_v_test.csv`)\n",

    "## 2.3 Trying Different Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    " My first instinct was that the problem was with this line in `minimal_example_real.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "`simulation_qacc_t = np.gradient(simulation_qvel_t, t, axis=0, edge_order=1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue could be that, since I a post-computing acceleration instead of collecting it between different trials, the acceleration could be way off. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a plot of qacc. The spikes correspond to the start of each trial, so this intuition is likely correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./outputs/v_acc_test.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"auto\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried setting `qacc` to 0 at the beginning and end of each trial. I got the following graph, but SINDy still won't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./outputs/v_acc_test_0.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"auto\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the `qacc` for `vs` looked reasonable in both cases.\n",

    "<img src=\"./outputs/vs_acc_test_0.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"auto\" />\n",
